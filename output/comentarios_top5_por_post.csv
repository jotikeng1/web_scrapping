1np9hz9,Turns Out Trump’s Own Team Messed Up U.N.

Eight days after he was unceremoniously yanked off the air, Jimmy Kimmel returned to ABC Tuesday night with a monologue that got right to the point. “I’m happy to be here tonight with all of you,” Kimmel began. “I’m not sure who had a weirder 48 hours—me or the CEO of Tylenol.”

Kimmel then thanked everyone who reached out to him in the week he was off the air, including fellow late night hosts Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, John Oliver, Conan O’Brien, and former ABC host James Corden. He also made a point of thanking “the people who don't support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway”—folks like Ben Shapiro, Clay Travis, Candace Owens, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, and even Kimmel’s longtime antagonist Ted Cruz, all of whom publicly supported Kimmel’s right to free speech following his suspension.

Last week, ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live after comments Kimmel made about the MAGA movement’s response to the murder of Charlie Kirk raised the ire of the Trump administration. The decision came after FCC Chair Brendan Carr complained about Kimmel on a right-wing podcast and threatened to investigate ABC if it did not take action against the comedian. Following Carr’s comments, affiliates owned by the conglomerates Nexstar and Sinclair announced they would preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live—and in turn, ABC announced that the show had been pulled from the air “indefinitely.”

Though Kimmel directly addressed Carr’s criticism—and poked fun at the federal employee’s total about-face regarding the importance of political satire—he also sounded a note of contrition about the comments that had led to his suspension in the first place. “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man,” Kimmel said, his voice breaking. “I don't think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn't, ever.”

At the end of his monologue, Kimmel also praised Erika Kirk for the comments she made at her husband’s livestreamed memorial on Sunday night. “I don’t know if you saw this—Erika Kirk forgave the man who shot her husband,” he said. “That is an example we should follow. If you believe in the teachings of Jesus, as I do, there it was. That’s it. A selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow. It touched me deeply.”

On Monday, Disney announced that Kimmel’s show—which has aired on ABC since January 2003—would return to the air. In a statement, the nation’s largest media company said that it had suspended the show “to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” adding that it “spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy.” Though Disney relented, viewers across the country who access ABC through affiliates owned by Many viewers access ABC through affiliate networks, and two of the largest affiliate operators, Sinclair and Nexstar, said they would preempt the show after Disney announced his return.

In the aftermath of Kimmel’s suspension, activists launched a campaign urging a Disney boycott, and there were signs that the agitation was having an effect. Kimmel subtly referenced the rumored spike in cancellations in another monologue joke. “Disney has asked me to read the following statement,” he said, opening up a piece of paper, then deadpanning, “To reactivate your Disney+ and Hulu account…” In response, the audience cheered.

In between jokes, Kimmel acknowledged the serious effects of the president’s obsession with late night TV. “Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can’t take a joke,” Kimmel said. “He was somehow able to squeeze Colbert out of CBS. Then he turned his sights on me, and now he’s openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers—and the hudnreds of Americans who work for their shows, who don’t make millions of dollars. And I hope that if that happens—or if there’s even any hint of that happening—you will be ten times as loud as you were this week.”",298,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1np68ig/jimmy_kimmel_doesnt_spare_trump_as_he_returns_to/nfwu9ru/

1np6nt3,New Zealand loosens residency restrictions as record number of citizens leave,nfx2lpc,"Yea - it's because we have a right-wing government who gave a 3 billion tax-cut to landlords which they paid for by gutting the health-service, and taking food away from kids. They sacked 10s of 1000s of govt workers, severely degrading local economies. On my street in the last couple of years half the business have closed at about the same time as rents have gone up by $300 (from around $450) a week, which this govt will do nothing about because they're all fucking landlords. 

NZ is a primary food producer, and 1 in 10 of us are dependent on food donations. The landlords on the other hand are partying like parasites blind to the fact that they're killing the host.

Zelensky really impressed me with his deep knowledge of what Putin is up to and my overriding impression from this session and the speeches made at the U.N. is that WW3 is already de facto in progress. Russia is actively probing NATO for signs of weakness and NATO is preparing to engage Russia in a now inevitable broader conflict.

Zelenskyy seems to think China is on the fence and they are not committed to peace because they could end the war right now if they stopped supporting Russia, especially by not buying Russian petroleum products. Russia is now dependent on China for survival.

The main win for the West is that America, or more specifically Trump, is back on board with NATO but at the same time Trump’s fickleness means America can no longer be trusted to be a reliable partner.

1np3d8z,Trump says NATO should shoot down Russian aircraft violating its airspace,nfwdb5i,"Here's a real non-circle jerk comment:

  
Trump is reading the tea leaves.  6 months ago, Trump told Zelenskyy ""You don't have the cards"".  And Trump wasn't completely wrong at the time.  Ukraine was getting pushed back repeatedly.  To this day, Russia is still gaining Ukrainian territory every month.  

  
But now that Russian momentum seems to be slowing.  Ukraine is hitting back hard at Russia with homegrown weapons that are targeting the lifeblood of the Russian economy.  Russia is being forced to react and spread already low anti-air supplies even thinner.  This has allowed Ukraine to ""pop Russia in the jaw"" a few times.  Until some new flavor is introduced, Russia doesn't appear to have an answer for this recent Ukrainian counterattack.  Russia's economy is in tatters and the military is stalled and aimless.  Whatever Ukraine has done in the last 6 months, they seem to have found ""some cards""

  
Now is absolutely not the time to allow Russia to fly in on ""protected routes"" using NATO airspace.  I agree with Trump on this issue.  These drones/planes blatantly violating airspace should be shot down.  It is Russia's responsibility to not fly military aircraft over hostile airspace on a whim.",182,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1np3d8z/trump_says_nato_should_shoot_down_russian/nfwdb5i/

Abolfazl Zohrevand, a member of parliament’s National Security Committee, called the MiG-29s a “short-term solution” while [Tehran](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/tehran) awaits the more advanced Sukhoi Su-35 jets, signaling a broader push to strengthen its military capabilities.

“Once these systems are fully in place, our enemies will understand the language of power,” Zohrevand told local media, highlighting Tehran’s determination to project strength as regional and global powers watch closely.

1npmgmc,Trump's U.N. speech was mortifying for America,ng09ih0,"**From Zeeshan Aleem, MSNBC opinion writer/editor:**

In President Donald Trump’s first speech to the United Nations General Assembly in 2017, he casually threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea. That wasn’t exactly an outlier. All his addresses to the General Assembly during that first term were crude, and at times shocking, pieces of “America First” oratory. But the speech Trump delivered Tuesday, which was more “Trump First” than “America First,” may have been the most blatantly *humiliating* one yet, as far as America’s reputation is concerned. Even more so than usual, Trump was bogged down by constant frivolous tangents and a fixation on trumpeting, often deceptively, what he counts as his accomplishments. And given that the backdrop of Trump’s speech is his all-out assault on democracy in his own country, his lecturing world leaders on how to run a great nation was shocking in its audacity.

Trump peppered his remarks with constant petty asides about the United Nations’ New York headquarters, where he delivered Tuesday’s speech. He joked that someone was going to be in “big trouble” for an apparently malfunctioning teleprompter. He repeatedly complained about a stalled escalator that had forced him to exert more energy than should have been necessary.

More significantly, he worked to undermine the credibility of the U.N. as an institution for peacekeeping and global governance. Everyone knows that the U.N.’s ability to enforce international law and produce binding resolutions is weak. But Trump’s specific attempt to prosecute this argument involved reprising a set of absurd and misleading talking points.

1nnpbbf,"Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?",nfofk05,"American Jews as a demographic are mostly Ashkenazim, meaning their families came to the US from Eastern European countries. Jews in America have largely been a part of the Democratic coalition since the New Deal. Prominent left-wing Israeli politicians like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir were also Ashkenazi and coming from socialist countries in the USSR may have influenced that. American Jews are also highly educated (which correlates with voting left-wing in the US) and are concentrated in states like blue states like New York, Illinois, and California, and purple states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida.

The majority of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi, which means their family came to Israel from Middle Eastern/Arab countries (or have lived in Israel for several generations). These voters, who experienced living in Arab countries are much more security minded and have experienced/heard stories of the persecution of Jews in Arab lands. One of the reasons that Israel went from having socialist leadership early on like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir, to conservative leadership like Sharon and Netanyahu is that Israel's early immigrants were Ashkenazi and over decades the country grew from Jewish immigrants being kicked out of Muslim countries like Yemen, Iraq, Morroco and migrating to Israel.

Trump is popular in Israel because he is viewed as being unapologetically pro-Israel and pro-Israeli security. He recognized Israeli annexation of the Golan, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem (de-facto recognizing it as Israel's capitol), and has been supportive of the war against Hamas in Gaza (for example Trump negotiated directly with Hamas on the release of an American Israeli captive Edan Alexander). Jews in Israel, receive the benefits of Trump's foreign policy without having to endure his Domestic policy. American Jews are socially liberal, and while many are supportive of Israel, they are more affected by Domestic US policy and vote left for social/economic reasons (abortion is overwhelmingly accepted in Judaism for example).",440,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/nfofk05/

1nnpbbf,"Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?",nfoghzz,"The American Evangelican Christian Right has promoted Israel since the 1970s. The Modern Evangelical Movement is highly Millennialist meaning that its very apocalyptic in a very immediate sense. This strain of Christianity stresses that the end times are going to happen any time now, or that they've already begun and we are now living through their opening stages. This idea creates an immediacy to their faith, that they must get right with God right now *or else.* In their interpretation of the End Times Israel is central to everything that will signal the Anti-Christ and the 1000 years of darkness will occur! In the Jewish Bible *Israel* refers to the Jewish People in covenant with their God, and in the New Testament it refers to the People of God which is anyone who's Christian who's soul is saved. The Evangelical Right has identified the State of Israel, which identifies itself as the nation of the Jewish People, as being their biblical Israel. 

So in a case of strange bed fellows many Evangelical Americans pushed for the US Government to become much more Pro-Israel and much more pro-active in supplying them weapons and regional support. They pushed really hard for about a decade for an American presidential candidate who was openly Pro-Christianity, Pro-""Family Values"", and importantly Pro-Israel. Haaaaaaaaaaaaave you met Ronald Reagan? The Reagan Administration leapt into partnering with Israel, even overlooking cases of Israeli espionage and industrial spying, treating it like another front in the global Cold War. 

Donald Trump is the inheritor of the American Political Right's need to promote Israel for their End of Days prophecies to come true. The Evangelical Right was an early and enthusiastic adopter of Donald J Trump because he made early and enthusiastic overtures to their leaders, who promoted him as The Man who was going to save the soul of America, right all of the wrongs, and who would stand up for their brand of Christianity in a forceful and open manner. I doubt Trump himself, as a private individual, has much regard or interest in Israel. He's reportedly called Jewish People who've worked for him (or who he's butted heads with) some remarkably un-politically correct nick names. Before his Presidency he had no great affinity with the Jewish community of New York as far as I can tell. 

But if he's to be the Defender of the Evangelical Christian Right and its cause, then promoting Israel and protecting it is of course what he's always been in favor of!",25,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/nfoghzz/

1nn6k1v,Trump says the tariffs are working and the US is getting richer from it. Is that true?,nfimif4,"1. Are tariffs making the U.S. “richer”?

•           Revenue Gains: Tariffs have indeed generated significant revenue. Between January and July 2025 alone, they brought in about \\$80.3 billion, and projections suggest up to \\$5.2 trillion over 10 years if current policies remain in place.

•           But at a cost: These revenues come with economic downsides. Estimates show U.S. GDP will shrink by 0.8% in the short term and could fall by up to 6% in the long run, with wages dropping about 5% and households facing a lifetime loss of \\$22,000.

•           Household impact: The average U.S. household is effectively paying an extra \\$1,300–\\$2,300 per year due to higher prices from tariffs.

Bottom line: Tariffs raise government revenue, but they act like a tax on consumers and businesses, reducing overall economic welfare.

2. How are tariffs affecting the U.S. economy?

•           Higher Prices & Inflation: Tariffs increase costs for imported goods, which ripple through supply chains. Prices for metals, autos, and consumer goods have surged, with some categories like leather and apparel seeing 35–37% price hikes.

•           Job Market: Employment is projected to decline by 480,000 jobs by the end of 2025, and unemployment could rise by 0.3–0.6 percentage points.

•           Sectoral Shifts: Manufacturing sees modest gains (+2.7%), but construction and agriculture shrink, and overall GDP remains smaller than before.

3. Impact on other countries and global economy

•           Global Slowdown: The World Bank warns of a \\$500 billion drop in global economic activity by 2026, and the IMF cut global growth forecasts by 0.6%.

•           Retaliation: Over 60 countries have retaliated. China imposed 84% tariffs on U.S. goods, targeting politically sensitive sectors like agriculture and autos. This led to bankruptcies among U.S. farmers and major losses for automakers like Ford.

•           Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies like Apple and Tesla are shifting production to India and Europe to avoid tariffs, while rare earth restrictions from China hit U.S. defense and tech sectors.

•           Financial Markets: Stock markets reacted negatively; the S&P 500 fell 3% after major tariff announcements, and currency volatility increased.

4. Strategic Goals vs. Reality

Trump’s tariffs aim to:

•           Reduce trade deficits.

•           Encourage domestic manufacturing.

•           Use tariffs as leverage in global negotiations.

However, these goals come with inflationary pressures, slower growth, and strained global relations. While some reshoring is happening, it’s slow and costly, and global supply chains remain deeply interconnected.

In short: Tariffs are not a free lunch. They generate revenue but act as a hidden tax on consumers, slow economic growth, and create global instability. The U.S. government might be “richer” in terms of tariff revenue, but households and businesses are paying the price.

1nlal7x,Is using military force against suspected drug-trafficking boats constitutional or an overreach of presidential power?,nf4n2lk,"This is one of Trumps legal grey areas and it is strictly in how you frame it that states if it is legal or a overreach.

Legal - Using military force against suspected drug trafficking boats can be constitutional and justified, especially when cartels act more like paramilitary threats than ordinary criminals. Under the President’s Article II powers and existing law, including international maritime agreements, the U.S. has legal authority to target such threats in international waters. Arrest isn't always possible, these boats may be armed, evasive, and pose immediate risks. Cartels fuel violence, terrorism, and the opioid crisis, making swift military action a necessary defense tool. This isn’t executive overreach, it’s a response to a modern, transnational threat.

Overreach - Using military force against suspected drug trafficking boats without due process is a dangerous overreach of presidential power. These are suspects, not enemy combatants, and targeting them with lethal force skips arrest, trial, and legal accountability, violating constitutional protections like due process. Labeling traffickers as “terrorists” doesn’t grant unlimited power, otherwise, any group could be targeted without oversight. This sets a troubling precedent for extrajudicial killings and undermines international law. Drug trafficking is a crime, not a war, and the response should involve law enforcement, not missiles. Security must not come at the cost of constitutional limits.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nlal7x/is_using_military_force_against_suspected/nf4n2lk/

Obviously this far from a presidential election, there's no White House contender, who would naturally become the leader of the party.

If they are given another chance to pass meaningful legislation, they should pass a major immigration reform bill. The only thing both sides agree on is our current immigration system is awful.

The devil is in the details, coming up with a new framework for immigration that acknowledges the reality of our dependence on illegal labor while not alienating a significant amount of americans would be very difficult.

Number one is to make capital gains tax rates equal to income tax rates. This notion that the money you make on money is somehow different than income is inherently unfair and favors the wealthy tremendously. 

Number two is to focus more on corporate rates than personal ones. The biggest tax avoidance in the nation is corporate. We often see citations about how high tax rates were under Eisenhower but rarely do we see that specifically mentioned in regard to corporations. Individuals have natural limitations on how they can avoid taxation but companies can easily minimize their tax burden by putting excess profit to work within the company and taking it off the profit margin. Facilities, salaries, research and development are all reinvestment strategies that would help the company and the economy at large without necessarily increasing tax revenue massively. 

We think of the “fair share” terminology in individual terms but all of the richest people are only so wealthy because of their asset value as major shareholders in massive companies. By using tax policy to encourage reinvestment, those individuals would automatically be “worth” less but their companies would be making a more beneficial contribution to the economy on broad terms",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nm2c8v/what_is_fair_for_taxes/nfbt5as/

1nmo35z,"Do oppressed groups have a duty, not just a right, to resist systemic threats, and if so, what methods are justified?",nfipl3b,"I think the toughest part of this is the methods section. Oppressed people (black, indigenous, LGBTQA+, or what have you) do have a duty to resist as do their fellow citizens have a duty to resist in their defense.

However, as to methods, any framework you arrive at can and will be used by whomever your opponents are. MAGA thinks they are oppressed. They think of themselves are the aggrieved party. I don’t agree with that at all but they do hence Trumps retribution messaging in 2020. 

To use a recent example, Harry Reid ended the use of the filibuster for most presidential nominations (except the Supreme Court) over the objection of Mitch McConnell who promised Republicans would end up taking it a step further if Reid followed through. Republicans later took over the Senate and McConnell announced he was getting rid of the filibuster on judges at the Supreme Court level too leading to Trumps 3 picks. By shattering a norm democrats left themselves open. 

Going back to Rome, if you want a classical example, once minor violence started being allowed near the Senate it escalated until there were basically riots and warring factions killing each other which intern led to their civil war.

I would say that the ""right"" to resist is self-evident, even if it may not be specifically codified into law.  It's not unlike the right to defend oneself if physically assaulted by a violent attacker.  

Whether that translates into an actual ""duty"" is another matter.  Some religions might say one should ""turn the other cheek"" and not fight back.  Some might say ""Let yourself be killed, but do not kill.""",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nmo35z/do_oppressed_groups_have_a_duty_not_just_a_right/nflekdo/

1no63e2,Would it be better for US President (or other World Leaders) to not tie themselves to a political party ?,nfuum07,"So a system in which candidates run without party affiliation but anyone with access to Google will see their previous party affiliation as a Senator or a Governor or House Member or MP would effectively be the exact same thing but messier because you’d have multiple “independents” running as former Republicans or former Democrats. Likely with most dropping out and endorsing the leading “independent” that came from their own party instead of being eliminated in a primary. No, fewer parties is not the answer to negative partisanship, it’s more. In a first past the post system I can get elected by convincing you that I’m better than the other candidate and I can do that by building myself up or I can do that by attacking and tearing down the other candidate. In fact, it’s a helluva lot easier to just tear the other candidate down and run as the lesser evil. But if I have 5 other viable candidates to run against then it’s a lot harder to portray them all as monsters that can’t be let into office because they’re such a huge treat. Too many of them are going to share major planks of my own platform. No, if we’re talking about a massive overhaul of how heads of government elections operate then you just have to look at countries who already manage to have those elections without hyper polarization and crib off them. Imo that means no direct elections for heads of government, adopt a parliamentary system where the MPs are elected using something along the lines of party list proportional representation and then allow for either an outright majority to win or for a coalition government to be negotiated (you’re also a helluva lot less likely to see too much partisanship when politicians know they may have to negotiate with some of the other parties to form a government down the road).",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1no63e2/would_it_be_better_for_us_president_or_other/nfuum07/

Bill Clinton did exactly what you’re describing. In an attempt to appeal to Republicans votes, he adopted a few core Republican tenets. The results were the dilution of the left and the political death of moderate Republican.
